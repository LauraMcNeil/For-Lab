Software Function: This program asks for the user's name and age, and calculates how much younger or older the user is compared to me (who is 18). I (Laura McNeil) also have worked on the program, making it take the average of the user's age and Jace's, and then print it out. 

How to Contribute: If you would like to contribute create new fork, make your changes, and request your changes to be added to the project
